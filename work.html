            <p>Blew Up A Hospital: <br><br>

                
            The motive behind the Joker's decision to blow up the hospital is rooted in his anarchic philosophy. Throughout the movie, the Joker seeks to create chaos and prove that anyone, even the seemingly noble and incorruptible, can be pushed into moral compromise or madness. The hospital explosion is a manifestation of his desire to break down societal order and expose the fragility of the moral fabric in Gotham.<br><br>
            The Joker revels in creating situations where individuals are forced to make morally compromising choices or face dire consequences. By targeting Gotham General Hospital, a symbol of order and healing, the Joker aims to show that even places associated with benevolence can be corrupted and destroyed.<br><br>
            The complexity of the plan also reflects the Joker's strategic mind and his ability to manipulate events to achieve maximum chaos, the Joker constantly challenges Batman, Gotham's citizens, and even the criminals, pushing them to question their values and sanity.<br><br>

            <p>Kidnapped Harvey and Rachel: <br><br>
                
            The Joker then wants to see what Batman will do, again he says so in the film. “And tonight you're gonna break your one rule.” Of course that doesn't happen, so the Joker changes his agenda again. Finally, he sets out to break everyone's spirit by tearing down Gotham’s white knight, Harvey Dent.<br><br>
            Knowing how the Joker thinks, I would say that he knew Harvey wasn't Batman after the press conference. So what does the Joker do? He plans to get himself locked up in the MCU while his men kidnap Rachel and Harvey, which will insure his escape with Lau later on.<br><br>
            The Joker also needed Batman to go after Dent, that's why he switched the addresses on purpose. He knew Batman loved Rachel and he counted on Dent turning bad over losing her. Becoming Two-Face was just an added bonus. Again, remember the Joker's words, “No, you need an ace in the hole; Harvey's mine.”
